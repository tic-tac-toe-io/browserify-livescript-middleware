## Why creating `browserify-livescript-middleware`

Before creating my own module, I've surveyed simialr modules for a while. But, only one module is found: [livescript-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livescript-middleware). It is simple and good to use, but cannot meet all of my requirements listed as below.



### 1. Modularization

[livescript-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livescript-middleware) only compiles one livescript source file, but I want a single javascript is generated by JS bundler from multiple compiled livescript source files, in order to make codes cleaner and smaller.

```livescript
require! <[xterm]>
helpers = require '../common/helpers'
log = require '../common/log'
```

With bundler and livescript transpiler, it's possible to combine javascript sources from `node_modules` directory that are installed by `npm` or `bower`, and also possible to combine livescript sources from the designated directories.

In order to align with mobile app development (w/ [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)) and embedded linux app development (minified and standalone javascript application on top of nodejs), we select [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) as the bundler.


### 2. Source Map Support

It's 2019, and I want source code map support in this middleware.



### 3. Configurable Source Transform and Bundler

[livescript-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livescript-middleware) uses `express.static` to serve the generated javascript files, but I want to serve these generated javascript files with cache behaviors configurable from HTTP query strings.



### 4. ES6+

[livescript-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livescript-middleware) already uses [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) to minify the bundled javascript, but it only supports ECMAScript 5. In order to bundle livescript and javascript with ES6+ standards, we need [uglify-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-es).


### 5. Latest Compiler

[livescript-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livescript-middleware) was not updated for past 4 years, and it was developed for livescript v1.4. So, we want this middleware can be tested with latest livescript [v1.6](https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript/releases/tag/1.6.0) (released at Aug 24, 2018) or the latest-forked livescript [v1.6.1](https://github.com/ischenkodv/LiveScript/commits/master) with better source code map support.
